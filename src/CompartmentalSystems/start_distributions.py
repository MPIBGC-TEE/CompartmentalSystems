"""Module for computing age distributions or moments thereof to be used
as start distributions in subsequent simulations.

The age distribution at the start :math:`t_0` is NOT
defined by the reservoir model and the initial values.
In fact EVERY age distribution can be chosen.
The implemented algorithms will correctly project it
to any time :math:`t`.
This module provides several ways to generate such a distribution.


The functions containing the word 'distributions' usually return a vector
valued function of age representing pool wise age distributions that
are NOT normalized (Integrating of a vector component over all ages
yields the mass of the corresponding pool.)
, and in some cases a start vector that should be used in the subsequent
simulation for which the start age distribution is computed.

The functions containing the word 'moments' usually return an
array: moments x pools, containing the moments of the
pool ages .
representing the initial values needed for the moment systems e.g. the
mean of a start distribution to be used as initial value for the
mean age system. The length of the list is determined by the maximum order of
the moment system to be solved.
In some cases a consistent start vector is also provided.


Zero start age distributions
----------------------------
The distributions eaisiest to imagine are those that start with zero age:

#.  The one with all pools empty provided by:
    :py:meth:`start_age_distributions_from_zero_initial_content
    and the respective moments by:
    :py:meth:`start_age_moments_from_zero_initial_content

#.  The one where all initial mass has age zero, provided by:
    :py:meth:`start_age_distributions_from_zero_age_initial_content

Established distributions
----------------------------
However for many applications one is interested in the CHANGE of an age
distribution that has been established over a (possibly infinitely) long period
of time.

#.  Spinup

    If we start the computation with all pools empty at time :math:`0`
    and run it till time :math:`t = a_{max}`,
    the resulting distribution will be non zero only in the interval
    :math:`[0,a_{max}]`.
    Such a distribution is provided by:
    :py:meth:`start_age_distributions_from_empty_spinup`
    and the moments by:
    :py:meth:`start_age_moments_from_empty_spinup

    Note that the finiteness of the spin up time has to be considered in the
    choice of questions that can be asked.
    For instance do not mistake the fact that the percentage
    of material older than :math:`a_{max}` will increase over
    time for a property of the system, where it is actually a
    property of the start distribution resulting from the finiteness
    of the spin up time.


#.  Distributions induced by steady states of the autonomous system, if those
    exist.

    If the term 'established' is taken to the limit of infinity one can look
    for a related system that has persisted unchanged for all  times
    :math:`t<t_0` and start with the age distribution created by such a system.
    Such a distribution can only occur if the system has been in a steady
    state. For a general non-autonomous system this is very unlikely that such
    a steady state exist at all.
    However we can consider a related autonomous system resulting from
    'freezing' the general non-autonomous system at a time :math:`t_0`.
    Even for such an autonomous system it is uncertain if and where equilibria
    exist. This has to be checked before an equilibrium age distribution can be
    computed.
    Actually the following steps have to be performed:

    a.  Transform the general nonlinear non-autonomous system
        into a nonlinear autonomous system by freezing it
        at time :math:`t=t_0`:

    b.  Compute :math:`u_0(x)=u(t_0,x_0)` and :math:`B_0(x)=B(t_0,x_0)`

    c.  Look for an equilibrium :math:`x_{fix}` of the frozen system
        such that :math:`0=B_0(x_{fix})+u_0(x_{fix})`.
        If the frozen system is linear the we can compute
        the fixed point explicitly : :math:`x_{fix}=B_0^{-1}u_0`.
        In general the frozen system will be nonlinear and we will have to
        look for the fixed point numerically.
    d.  Compute the age distribution of the system at equilibrium
        :math:`x_{fix}`.
        This can be done using the formulas for linear
        autonomous pool models. (At the fixed point the nonlinear system
        is identical to a linear one. This is a special case of the general
        idea of linearizing a nonlinear model with respect to a trajectory,
        which in case of a fixed point is constant.)

    All these steps are performed by
    :py:meth:`start_age_distributions_from_steady_state`
    and
    :py:meth:`start_age_moments_from_steady_state`.

    Note that :math:`x_{fix}` is the compatible start vector that has to be
    used along with this start distributions for the following computation.

                No initial guess for the fix point iteration given.
                For nonlinear models equilibria can in general only be found
                numerically by an iterative process starting from an initial
                guess x0 which has not been provided.
                Since a nonlinear model can have several equilibria the initial
                guess determines which one will be found by the iteration.
                A good guess might also increase the likelihood to find an
                equilibrium at all.
                In absence of an initial guess we will start with
                numpy.ones(smr.nr_pools) which might not be a good choice.
                We strongly advise to specify the x0 argument."""
